# Othello
Othello Game (also named as reversi) with Computer as the Opponent.

## Why PyGame ?

PyGame is the most classic SDL library for Game GUI development. Python and SDL is suitable for the development of 2D games. PyGame is at the relatively lower level and you can control most things by yourself. It would be easier for simple display like reversi.

Keep it simple!
